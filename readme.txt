Ray Tracer
Project 2 for Computer Graphics
By Jack Garrard

This program creates a scene that is created from a json file. The graphics procedure it uses is called ray casting and it involves testing for the nearests objects color with rays.

The output of this program is in ppm type 3 style.

Usage: raycast.c width height input.json output.ppm
width: the width of the final image in pixels
height: the height of the final image in pixels
input.json: the input json file to read the scene from
output.ppm: the output file to write the image to. 


I plan to add Quadric support for cooler shapes later. Along with that I want to make some parts of my code use more elegant solutions in order to solve different ideas.
I really enjoyed this project and hope we add more to it later.
